						<h2>Welcome to the Grasslands Trail Run</h2>

						<p>
						LBJ National Grasslands<br/>
						Near Decatur, Texas
						</p>

						<p>
						50M, 26.2M &amp; 13.1M Trail Runs
						</p>

						<p>
						The Grasslands Trail Run was started in 1999 by Suzi Cope, the first woman to complete the Grand Slam of Ultrarunning. The race is held in the LBJ National Grasslands, an area maintained by the USDA Forest Service and the Friends of the Grasslands, a nonprofit organization. In order to hold the Grasslands Trail Race, NTTR must file a special use permit with the USDA Forest Service. Please help us return to the Grasslands each year by following and respecting all rules. A portion of the race proceeds are donated to the Friends of the Grasslands to support their efforts in maintaining the trails.
						</p>

						<p>
						Registration for the Grasslands Trail Run includes a race shirt, finisher's medal (marathon and half marathon) or buckle (50 miler), and an after-race meal for all participates. For more than 15 years, the Grasslands Trail Run has provided a day of fun on a relatively flat but still challenging course.
						</p>

						<p>
						Texas weather guaranteed! In other words, it could be hot, warm, beautiful, rainy, windy, or snowing. We've had it all and people love it.
