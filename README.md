# GL-Responsive
Refactored website for a club run website.  Uses Bootstrap and jQuery. 

This is an effort to refactor a website for a club run.  The goal was to update the website to make it responsive, and to update the styling.  

Most of the HTML code is left over from the original website, with updates made to use the following Bootstrap features:
* Navigation
* Carousel
* Bootstrap Grid
* Bootstrap Styles

While the original goal was to deploy this project and have it used in production, I ran into backward compatibility issues with older browsers that I did not have time to resolve prior to this year's race.  I elected to shelve the project for now, until I have more time to work on it in the future.  

After going through this exercise, I am more inclined to look into using WordPress, or something similar for this project.  Regardless, I learned a great deal in working with both Bootstrap, HTML 5, and jQuery.
